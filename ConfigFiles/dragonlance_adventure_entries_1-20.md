# D&D 5e Dragonlance Adventure: Entries 1-20

## Entry 1: The Crossroads of Solace
The autumn wind carries the scent of dying leaves and distant smoke as you stand at the crossroads outside the village of Solace. The massive vallenwood trees stretch their ancient branches overhead, their golden leaves rustling with whispers of approaching winter. Behind you, the familiar sight of the Inn of the Last Home perches high in the branches, its warm light beckoning travelers to safety. Ahead, three paths diverge: one leads north toward the mysterious Darken Wood, another winds east toward the port city of Haven, and the third curves south toward the Plains of Dust. A weathered signpost bears carved warnings about bandits and worse dangers lurking in the wilderness. Your coinpurse jingles softly with your remaining silver, barely enough for a night's lodging, and your stomach growls with hunger. The choice of where to begin your adventure weighs heavily on your mind.

**Choose your path:**
A) Head north toward Darken Wood, seeking ancient secrets (Go to Entry 2)
B) Take the eastern road to Haven, looking for work at the port (Go to Entry 5)
C) Journey south to the Plains of Dust, following rumors of treasure (Go to Entry 8)
D) Return to the Inn of the Last Home for information and rest (Go to Entry 11)

## Entry 2: The Edge of Darken Wood
The northern path leads you through increasingly sparse farmland until you reach the ominous border of Darken Wood. Ancient oaks and shadowtop trees form a wall of twisted branches and perpetual twilight that seems to swallow sound itself. Local legends speak of this place as cursed, where the undead walk freely and dark magic lingers from the Cataclysm. A faint path disappears into the gloom between two massive tree trunks carved with warning runes. As you pause at the forest's edge, you notice fresh footprints in the soft earth—someone or something has recently entered the woods. The temperature drops noticeably as shadows seem to reach toward you with grasping fingers. Your hand instinctively moves to your weapon as an unnatural silence falls over the area.

**Make your choice:**
A) Follow the footprints into Darken Wood immediately (Go to Entry 3)
B) Make a Survival check (DC 15) to track the prints and learn more about what made them (Success: Go to Entry 4, Failure: Go to Entry 3)
C) Camp here for the night and enter the woods at dawn (Go to Entry 14)
D) Decide this is too dangerous and return to the crossroads (Go to Entry 1)

## Entry 3: Into the Shadowed Depths
Steeling your nerves, you step across the threshold into Darken Wood, and immediately feel the oppressive weight of ancient malevolence. The canopy above blocks out most of the daylight, creating a perpetual dusk that plays tricks on your eyes. Strange whispers seem to follow your footsteps, and branches creak ominously without any wind to move them. After what feels like hours of walking deeper into the forest, you come upon a clearing where the remains of an old watchtower jut from the earth like broken teeth. Scattered around its base are the bleached bones of various creatures, and a foul stench of decay hangs heavy in the air. Suddenly, three skeletal warriors emerge from behind the tower ruins, their empty eye sockets glowing with unholy light. They advance with rusted weapons raised, and you realize there's no avoiding this combat.

**Combat Options:**
A) Charge the skeletons head-on with a melee attack (Go to Entry 15)
B) Make a Ranged attack if you have appropriate weapons (Go to Entry 16)
C) Attempt to Turn Undead if you're a Cleric or Paladin (Go to Entry 17)
D) Try to flee back the way you came (Go to Entry 18)

## Entry 4: Reading the Signs
Your keen eye examines the footprints carefully, and you notice several important details that others might miss. The prints belong to a humanoid wearing leather boots, but the gait is uneven, suggesting an injury or limp. More disturbing, you spot what appears to be dried blood on some of the leaves nearby, and the tracks seem to weave erratically rather than following the straight path. Based on the depth and spacing of the prints, you estimate they were made by someone of average height but carrying a heavy burden. Most concerning of all, you notice a second set of tracks—these belonging to something much larger with clawed feet that seems to be following the first set. The blood trail leads deeper into the woods, and you realize someone may be in grave danger.

**What do you do:**
A) Follow the tracks quickly to try to help whoever is injured (Go to Entry 19)
B) Proceed cautiously, making a Stealth check (DC 12) to avoid detection (Success: Go to Entry 20, Failure: Go to Entry 3)
C) Call out to see if anyone responds (Go to Entry 15)
D) Mark this location and return to get help from Solace (Go to Entry 1)

## Entry 5: The Road to Haven
The eastern road stretches before you like a ribbon of packed earth winding through rolling hills dotted with abandoned farmsteads. The journey to Haven typically takes two days on foot, but the road has become increasingly dangerous since the War of the Lance ended. Merchant caravans now travel in armed groups, and lone travelers are easy prey for desperate bandits and worse creatures. As the sun climbs higher, you notice storm clouds gathering on the horizon, promising rain before nightfall. About midday, you crest a hill and spot a overturned merchant wagon in the distance, its cargo scattered across the road. Smoke rises from what appears to be a small fire nearby, but you can't tell if anyone is still alive. Your conscience wars with your caution as you consider whether to investigate or continue on to Haven.

**Your decision:**
A) Investigate the overturned wagon to see if anyone needs help (Go to Entry 6)
B) Make a Perception check (DC 14) to survey the scene from a distance first (Success: Go to Entry 7, Failure: Go to Entry 6)
C) Avoid the wagon entirely and circle wide around it (Go to Entry 12)
D) Hide and observe the area for a while before deciding (Go to Entry 13)

## Entry 6: The Merchant's Plight
As you approach the overturned wagon, you discover a middle-aged merchant named Gareth trapped beneath one of the heavy wooden wheels. His leg is clearly broken, and he's barely conscious from pain and blood loss. The wagon's cargo of fine textiles and pottery lies scattered and mostly ruined, but you notice several intact items that might be valuable. Gareth manages to gasp out that his wagon was attacked by bandits about an hour ago, and they made off with his horses and most valuable goods. He begs you to help free him, promising a reward if you can get him to safety. The merchant's water barrel is intact, and you have the supplies needed to treat his injuries, but moving him could be dangerous without proper equipment. Time is running short as the storm clouds continue to gather overhead.

**How do you help:**
A) Make a Medicine check (DC 13) to treat his injuries before attempting to move him (Success: Go to Entry 9, Failure: Go to Entry 10)
B) Try to lift the wagon wheel with a Strength check (DC 16) to free him quickly (Success: Go to Entry 9, Failure: Go to Entry 10)
C) Search the area for materials to create a makeshift stretcher (Go to Entry 11)
D) Leave him here and promise to send help from Haven (Go to Entry 12)

## Entry 7: A Closer Look
Your careful observation reveals important details that could save your life. Through the scattered debris, you can see that this wasn't a random bandit attack—the wagon was deliberately overturned and searched with methodical precision. More troubling, you spot several sets of footprints around the wagon that don't match normal bandits' boots, but rather appear to be made by military-style footwear. Hidden in the tall grass nearby, you catch a glimpse of metal that could be armor or weapons. The merchant trapped under the wheel seems genuine in his distress, but something about this entire scene feels like a carefully laid trap. Your instincts tell you that whoever did this might still be nearby, waiting for a good Samaritan to investigate.

**Your course of action:**
A) Approach cautiously with weapons ready (Go to Entry 6)
B) Call out a warning to the merchant about the potential trap (Go to Entry 13)
C) Make a Stealth check (DC 15) to circle around and observe from a different angle (Success: Go to Entry 20, Failure: Go to Entry 15)
D) Retreat immediately and continue toward Haven (Go to Entry 12)

## Entry 8: The Southern Plains
The path south leads you away from the familiar forests of Solace and onto the vast expanse of the Plains of Dust. The landscape gradually transforms from green hills to golden grasslands that stretch endlessly toward the horizon. Ancient ruins dot the plains like broken teeth, remnants of civilizations lost to the Cataclysm centuries ago. The sun beats down mercilessly, and you're grateful for the water skin you filled before leaving Solace. As evening approaches, you spot a column of smoke rising from what appears to be a small settlement in the distance. The smoke could indicate a peaceful village preparing evening meals, or it might signal something more sinister. Your feet ache from the long walk, and you need to find shelter before the desert cold sets in after nightfall.

**What's your next move:**
A) Head directly toward the smoke to investigate the settlement (Go to Entry 14)
B) Make a Survival check (DC 12) to find a safe place to camp for the night (Success: Go to Entry 16, Failure: Go to Entry 15)
C) Climb a nearby hill to get a better view of the area (Go to Entry 17)
D) Continue walking through the night to cover more ground (Go to Entry 18)

## Entry 9: Successful Rescue
Your quick thinking and skilled hands save Gareth's life as you successfully treat his injuries and free him from the wagon. The merchant is weak but stable, and his gratitude is evident in his tear-filled eyes. He insists on giving you a small leather pouch containing 25 gold pieces as a reward, along with a silver pendant bearing the symbol of Mishakal, which he claims has protective properties. Gareth explains that he was traveling to Haven to sell his goods and purchase supplies for his shop in Solace. He offers to split any salvageable cargo with you if you help him reach Haven safely. The storm is approaching rapidly, and you need to find shelter soon, but the merchant can't travel far in his condition. Fortunately, you recall seeing an abandoned farmhouse about a mile back along the road that might provide adequate shelter.

**Your next step:**
A) Help Gareth to the abandoned farmhouse for shelter (Go to Entry 19)
B) Stay with the wagon and try to repair it enough to continue (Go to Entry 11)
C) Leave Gareth with supplies and go to Haven alone to get help (Go to Entry 12)
D) Make a Persuasion check (DC 14) to convince a passing traveler to help (Success: Go to Entry 20, Failure: Go to Entry 19)

## Entry 10: Complications Arise
Despite your best efforts, something goes wrong in your rescue attempt, and Gareth's condition worsens. His broken leg becomes more severely injured, and he slips into unconsciousness from the pain. The approaching storm makes the situation even more desperate, as the first drops of rain begin to fall. Without immediate medical attention, the merchant might not survive the night. You notice that his breathing is becoming labored, and his pulse is weak and irregular. The scattered cargo includes some medical supplies, but they're insufficient for treating such serious injuries. A difficult choice faces you: attempt to carry an unconscious man to safety, or leave him here while you seek help. The storm is intensifying, and lightning flashes illuminate the growing darkness.

**Your difficult choice:**
A) Attempt to carry Gareth to the abandoned farmhouse (Go to Entry 18)
B) Make camp here and tend to him through the storm (Go to Entry 15)
C) Leave him with what supplies you can and race to Haven for help (Go to Entry 12)
D) Search the area more thoroughly for additional medical supplies (Go to Entry 13)

## Entry 11: The Inn of the Last Home
The familiar warmth of the Inn of the Last Home envelops you as you climb the wooden stairs carved into the mighty vallenwood tree. The common room buzzes with conversation from local farmers, traveling merchants, and the occasional adventurer sharing tales of distant lands. Otik Sandath, the portly innkeeper, greets you with a warm smile and the aroma of his famous spiced potatoes fills the air. Tika Waylan, now a seasoned woman but still beautiful, serves drinks with practiced efficiency while keeping a watchful eye on the rowdier patrons. In one corner, you notice a hooded figure sitting alone, occasionally glancing around nervously. Near the fireplace, a group of local farmers discuss troubling reports of increased bandit activity on the roads. The atmosphere is welcoming, but you sense undercurrents of worry and tension among the patrons.

**What do you do:**
A) Approach the hooded figure to see if they need assistance (Go to Entry 14)
B) Join the farmers' conversation to learn about local troubles (Go to Entry 16)
C) Rent a room for the night and rest (Go to Entry 17)
D) Make an Investigation check (DC 12) to gather information about potential opportunities (Success: Go to Entry 18, Failure: Go to Entry 19)

## Entry 12: Avoiding Trouble
You decide that discretion is the better part of valor and give the overturned wagon a wide berth, continuing on the road to Haven. The detour takes you through rougher terrain, but you avoid whatever danger might have been lurking near the merchant's wagon. As you walk, you can't shake the feeling that you're being watched from the distant tree line. The storm clouds continue to gather, and you need to find shelter soon. About an hour later, you encounter a small patrol of Haven city guards returning from their rounds. Their leader, a grizzled sergeant named Marcus, eyes you suspiciously but listens to your story about the overturned wagon. He mentions that several merchant caravans have been attacked recently, and they suspect organized bandits rather than common roadside thieves. The guards offer to let you travel with them back to Haven for safety.

**Your response:**
A) Accept the guards' offer and travel with them to Haven (Go to Entry 20)
B) Ask them to investigate the wagon while you continue alone (Go to Entry 13)
C) Volunteer to guide them back to the wagon location (Go to Entry 6)
D) Make a Persuasion check (DC 13) to convince them to let you join their patrol (Success: Go to Entry 15, Failure: Go to Entry 20)

## Entry 13: Hidden Dangers
Your cautious approach pays off as you take time to carefully observe the situation before acting. From your concealed position, you watch the area around the overturned wagon for several minutes. Your patience is rewarded when you spot movement in the tall grass—at least three figures in dark clothing are positioned around the wagon, clearly waiting in ambush. The trapped merchant appears to be genuine, making this situation even more despicable as the bandits are using his suffering as bait. You also notice that one of the hidden figures carries a crossbow, while another has a sword drawn. The storm is approaching rapidly, and the first drops of rain begin to fall. You realize that if you don't act soon, the merchant might die regardless of the danger.

**Your tactical decision:**
A) Attempt to sneak around behind the ambushers (Go to Entry 15)
B) Create a distraction to draw them away from the merchant (Go to Entry 17)
C) Make a Deception check (DC 16) to trick the bandits into revealing themselves (Success: Go to Entry 19, Failure: Go to Entry 18)
D) Wait for the storm to worsen and use it as cover (Go to Entry 20)

## Entry 14: The Mysterious Stranger
You approach the hooded figure in the corner of the inn, noting how they seem to tense at your approach. As you draw closer, you catch a glimpse of elegant features and pointed ears—this person is clearly an elf, though their clothing and manner suggest they're trying to avoid attention. The elf looks up as you near their table, revealing intelligent green eyes filled with both wariness and desperation. In a low voice, they introduce themselves as Silvana Starweaver, a scholar from Qualinost who has been tracking disturbing magical disturbances throughout the region. She explains that ancient artifacts from the Age of Dreams have been surfacing, and someone is collecting them for unknown but certainly dangerous purposes. Silvana offers to pay handsomely for assistance in investigating these magical anomalies, but warns that the work will be extremely perilous.

**Your response:**
A) Accept Silvana's offer to investigate the magical disturbances (Go to Entry 16)
B) Ask for more details about the artifacts and their dangers (Go to Entry 17)
C) Suggest she hire more experienced adventurers (Go to Entry 11)
D) Make an Insight check (DC 15) to determine if she's telling the truth (Success: Go to Entry 18, Failure: Go to Entry 19)

## Entry 15: Combat Erupts
The situation explodes into violence as combat becomes unavoidable. Whether you're facing skeletal warriors in Darken Wood, bandits on the road, or other threats, your survival depends on quick thinking and skilled fighting. The clash of steel rings through the air as you engage your enemies, knowing that defeat could mean death in these dangerous lands. Your training and instincts take over as you fight for your life, dodging attacks and striking back with all the skill you possess. The battle is fierce and desperate, with both sides fighting with the knowledge that only the victors will walk away. As the combat continues, you realize that this is likely just the first of many dangerous encounters you'll face in your adventures.

**Combat Resolution:**
A) If you emerged victorious, search the fallen enemies for useful items (Go to Entry 19)
B) If you were wounded but survived, tend to your injuries before continuing (Go to Entry 20)
C) If you were defeated, you awaken later as a prisoner (Go to Entry 18)
D) If you fled successfully, regroup and plan your next move (Go to Entry 17)

## Entry 16: A Profitable Alliance
Your decision to work with Silvana proves immediately beneficial as she shares crucial information about the region's dangers and opportunities. She reveals that the magical disturbances are centered around three locations: an ancient temple in Darken Wood, a submerged ruin near Haven's harbor, and a buried vault somewhere in the Plains of Dust. Each location reportedly contains artifacts of immense power, but they're all heavily guarded by both magical and mundane threats. Silvana provides you with a map marking these locations and a small crystal that glows when near magical auras. She also gives you a letter of credit worth 100 gold pieces that can be honored at any major city. The elf emphasizes that time is crucial, as her sources suggest someone else is also seeking these artifacts for nefarious purposes.

**Choose your first destination:**
A) Investigate the ancient temple in Darken Wood (Go to Entry 2)
B) Explore the submerged ruin near Haven (Go to Entry 5)
C) Search for the buried vault in the Plains of Dust (Go to Entry 8)
D) Gather more information and supplies before departing (Go to Entry 11)

## Entry 17: The High Ground
Your decision to seek higher ground proves wise as you climb a nearby hill that offers a commanding view of the surrounding area. From this vantage point, you can see much more than was visible from ground level, and the broader perspective reveals important details about your situation. The view allows you to spot potential dangers, identify safe routes, and notice features of the landscape that might be significant to your quest. Whether you're scouting for enemies, looking for shelter, or trying to navigate unfamiliar terrain, the elevated position gives you a tactical advantage. As you survey the area, you notice several interesting features that weren't visible before, including what appears to be an old road leading toward distant ruins.

**What catches your attention:**
A) A hidden path leading to what looks like an ancient structure (Go to Entry 19)
B) Signs of a recent camp that might belong to other travelers (Go to Entry 20)
C) A natural cave formation that could provide shelter (Go to Entry 18)
D) Movement in the distance that might be friend or foe (Go to Entry 15)

## Entry 18: Unexpected Consequences
Your actions have led to an unexpected and challenging situation that requires careful handling. Whether you attempted to flee from danger, carried an injured person to safety, or made a difficult choice under pressure, the consequences are now becoming apparent. The situation has become more complex than you initially realized, and you must adapt quickly to the changing circumstances. Your decisions have created new opportunities and dangers, and you find yourself facing challenges that will test both your combat skills and your judgment. The path forward is unclear, but you know that decisive action is needed to resolve the situation successfully.

**How do you adapt:**
A) Take a direct approach and confront the challenge head-on (Go to Entry 15)
B) Look for an alternative solution that avoids direct confrontation (Go to Entry 19)
C) Seek help from others who might be able to assist (Go to Entry 20)
D) Make a Wisdom check (DC 14) to find the best course of action (Success: Go to Entry 17, Failure: Go to Entry 16)

## Entry 19: A Fortunate Discovery
Your careful investigation or helpful actions have led to a positive outcome that opens new possibilities for your adventure. Whether you successfully rescued someone, found hidden treasure, or uncovered important information, this discovery provides you with valuable resources or allies. The situation has resolved in your favor, and you now have access to new opportunities that weren't available before. Your actions have earned you respect, rewards, or crucial knowledge that will aid you in future challenges. However, with these new advantages come new responsibilities and potentially greater dangers as word of your success spreads.

**How do you proceed:**
A) Use your new resources to pursue a more ambitious goal (Go to Entry 16)
B) Share your good fortune with others who might need help (Go to Entry 20)
C) Keep your discovery secret and use it for personal advantage (Go to Entry 18)
D) Investigate further to see if there are additional opportunities (Go to Entry 17)

## Entry 20: The Path Forward
Your journey has reached a crucial juncture where the choices you make will significantly impact your future adventures. The experiences you've gained, the allies you've met, and the knowledge you've acquired have all prepared you for the greater challenges that lie ahead. Whether you've uncovered magical mysteries, helped those in need, or survived dangerous encounters, you now have a clearer understanding of the perils and opportunities that await in the world of Krynn. The road before you branches in multiple directions, each leading to different adventures and destinies. Your reputation is beginning to grow, and important figures are starting to take notice of your actions.

**Choose your destiny:**
