## Implementation Notes

**Modular Text System:**
- Each section uses conditional statements [IF SPECIES/CLASS/BACKGROUND] to insert appropriate text
- Base narrative remains consistent while personal details adapt to player choices
- Multiple conditions can be combined (e.g., [IF SPECIES IS KENDER AND CLASS IS ROGUE])

**Transition Flow:**
- Entry 100: Character completion and world-building
- Entry 101: Motivation and final preparations
- Entry 102: Final transition into main adventure

**Technical Requirements:**
- JavaScript/programming implementation should track all character creation variables
- Text blocks should be stored in arrays/objects keyed to character choices
- Fallback text should be provided for any unrecognized combinations

This system ensures every player feels their character choices matter while maintaining narrative coherence and smooth transition into the main adventure.
