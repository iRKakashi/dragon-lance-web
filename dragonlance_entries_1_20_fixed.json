      "narrative": "The autumn wind carries the scent of dying leaves and distant smoke as you stand at the crossroads outside the village of Solace. The massive vallenwood trees stretch their ancient branches overhead, their golden leaves rustling with whispers of approaching winter. Behind you, the familiar sight of the Inn of the Last Home perches high in the branches, its warm light beckoning travelers to safety. Ahead, three paths diverge: one leads north toward the mysterious Darken Wood, another winds east toward the port city of Haven, and the third curves south toward the Plains of Dust. A weathered signpost bears carved warnings about bandits and worse dangers lurking in the wilderness. Your coinpurse jingles softly with your remaining silver, barely enough for a night's lodging, and your stomach growls with hunger. The choice of where to begin your adventure weighs heavily on your mind.",

Local legends speak of this place as cursed, where the undead walk freely and dark magic lingers from the Cataclysm. A faint path disappears into the gloom between two massive tree trunks carved with warning runes. As you pause at the forest's edge, you notice fresh footprints in the soft earth—someone or something has recently entered the woods. The temperature drops noticeably as shadows seem to reach toward you with grasping fingers. Your hand instinctively moves to your weapon as an unnatural silence falls over the area.",

After what feels like hours of walking deeper into the forest, you come upon a clearing where the remains of an old watchtower jut from the earth like broken teeth. Scattered around its base are the bleached bones of various creatures, and a foul stench of decay hangs heavy in the air. Suddenly, three skeletal warriors emerge from behind the tower ruins, their empty eye sockets glowing with unholy light.

Gareth manages to gasp out that his wagon was attacked by bandits about an hour ago, and they made off with his horses and most valuable goods. He begs you to help free him, promising a reward if you can get him to safety.

She reveals that the magical disturbances are centered around three locations: an ancient temple in Darken Wood, a submerged ruin near Haven's harbor, and a buried vault somewhere in the Plains of Dust. Each location reportedly contains artifacts of immense power, but they're all heavily guarded by both magical and mundane threats. Silvana provides you with a map marking these locations and a small crystal that glows when near magical auras. She also gives you a letter of credit worth 100 gold pieces that can be honored at any major city. The elf emphasizes that time is crucial, as her sources suggest someone else is also seeking these artifacts for nefarious purposes.",
